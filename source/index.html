        <p>Have digital technologies made governments more willing and able to deliver services to their citizens? Not yet. Governments have invested heavily in digital technology over the past two decades, and these efforts have made it easier in many countries for businesses to file taxes, and for the poor to get an official identity allowing them to receive welfare payments and vote in elections. Digital technologies have also enabled governments to receive regular feedback from service users, improving service quality. But all too often the successes are isolated—limited to a few activities, sectors, or locales. Many investments in e-government fail to have any impact other than wasting scarce fiscal resources. Digital channels for mobilizing citizens to pressure policy makers to become more responsive have had little effect. And the new technologies have enhanced the capacity of unaccountable governments for surveillance and control. In sum, digital technologies have helped willing and able governments better serve their citizens, but they have not yet empowered citizens to make unwilling governments more accountable.</p>

        <p>Efficient service delivery requires a capable government that can implement policies and spend public resources effectively. <span class="smartlink smartlink--footnote smartlink--000">It also requires an empowered citizenry able to hold politicians and policy makers to account so that governments serve citizens and not themselves or a narrow set of elites.</span> Digital technologies can strengthen government capability and empower citizens through three mechanisms (figure 3.1). They overcome information barriers and promote participation by citizens in services and in elections. They enable governments to replace some factors used for producing services through the automation of routine activities, particularly discretionary tasks vulnerable to rent-seeking, and to augment other factors through better monitoring, both by citizens through regular feedback on service quality and within government through better management of government workers. And by dramatically lowering communication costs through digital platforms, they enable citizens to connect with one another at unprecedented scale, fostering citizen voice and collective action.</p>

      <section>
        <p>But the impact of these mechanisms on capability and empowerment depends on the strength of government institutions. Institutions are the formal and informal rules that shape the incentives and behaviors of politicians, government officials, and citizens. Strong institutions create incentives for politicians to work toward the public good and for bureaucrats to be accountable to those politicians. Digital technologies, aligned with the incentives of politicians, government officials, and service providers, can thus be highly effective in improving outcomes. By contrast, politicians in clientelist political institutions are largely accountable to a small set of elites and reject digitally enabled reforms that hurt vested interests; instead, they use these technologies for greater control. And patronage-based bureaucracies resist e-government advances that would reduce discretion and rent-seeking. This misalignment between digital technologies and weak or unaccountable institutions creates the twin risks of increasing elite control and wasting scarce public resources on ineffective e-government projects.</p>

        <p>Why do these institutional constraints persist? Digital technologies, particularly social media, have uncovered egregious abuses of public authority and triggered both virtual and physical citizen protests around scandals. But they haven’t sustained collective action around failures of service delivery. Service delivery problems are more difficult to monitor and attribute to specific government officials, and only rarely become salient in flashpoint events that trigger protests—like the excessive use of force by police. And they cannot be improved by one-off actions that change a bad policy or pass a new law. Addressing service delivery failures requires sustained citizen voice through effective offline mobilization by civil society organizations. But in the absence of willing and able governments to partner with, civil society initiatives often remain small, with limited citizen interest or impact.</p>

        <p>The dependence of digital technology on initial institutional conditions, though, varies by service and activity. For services and activities based on more routine tasks that are easy to monitor, digital technologies can improve outcomes rapidly and significantly—even when institutions are relatively weak. In effect, the technology substitutes for the institutions, as with cash transfers, licensing and registration services, and monitoring elections, all much improved by digital technologies in many low-income countries. But for services and activities that require more discretion from workers and are hard to monitor, the quality of institutions is much more important, and digital technologies have an incremental effect. The technology only complements or augments the initial institutions, as with teaching, health care, and organizational management, where digital technologies have an impact only if institutions are strong.</p>

        <p>Given the importance of institutions for service delivery, the policy agenda is to use digital technologies to strengthen institutions. The variation in interaction of institutions and digital technologies by service and activity, and the considerable heterogeneity of institutions even within countries, can guide policy and open many possibilities for service improvements in even the most challenging contexts—in short, for digital dividends.</p>

        <h3>Connected governments</h3>

        <p>The advent of the internet in the mid-1990s triggered the rapid diffusion of e-government systems to automate core administrative tasks, improve the delivery of public services, and promote transparency and accountability. <span class="smartlink smartlink--footnote smartlink--001">By 2014, all 193 member-states of the United Nations had national websites: 101 enabled citizens to create personal online accounts, 73 to file income taxes online, and 60 to register a business.</span> In all, 190 countries had automated government financial management, 179 had automated customs, and 159 had automated tax systems. And 148 countries had digital identification schemes, although only 20 had multipurpose digital identification for such services as voting, finance, health care, transportation, and social security.</p>

        <p>Developing countries have invested more in core government administration systems like financial management, customs, and tax management than in transactional government-to-citizen and government-to-business services like e-filing of taxes and portals that enable citizens to access a variety of services from one website (figure 3.2). <span class="smartlink smartlink--footnote smartlink--002">Policy priorities are also evident in cross-national patterns of the detailed indexes of different e-government systems constructed for this report.</span>  The level of e-government unsurprisingly increases with per capita income, but the gap between high-income and low-income countries is lowest for administrative systems and highest for online services for citizens and businesses, with digital identification systems in the middle (figure 3.3). Fifteen middle-income countries score in the top quartile of administrative e-government systems, with Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru in the top 10 worldwide, and Nepal, Rwanda, and Uganda scoring highly among low-income countries. India and Pakistan have more advanced digital identification systems than high-income North American countries, pointing to the potential for “leapfrogging” that these technologies offer.</p>

      <section>
        <p>Governments are more intensive users of information technology than firms. Survey data on the use of digital technologies (computers, mobile phones, and the internet) in nonagricultural jobs from 30 countries show that in all but one country, a higher share of public sector workers are in jobs that require frequent use of the technology in their daily work as compared to private sector workers (figure 3.4). This gap is not surprising for developing countries, where most firms are small and in the informal sector.</p>

        <p>For example, more than 60 percent of public sector workers are in jobs that require intensive use of technologies in Bolivia, Colombia, and Kenya, compared with only approximately 20 percent of private sector workers. But the gap persists in 22 of the countries when the public sector is compared only with large private sector firms (those with more than 50 employees). Governments are also more intensive users of technology in high-income countries like Germany, Japan, and the United States.</p>

        <p>Whether this substantial investment in e-government has strengthened state capability and improved outcomes will be explored at length in the next section. One indication of the limited return on these investments is citizen use of e-government services, which has lagged behind supply (figure 3.5, panel a). Even in countries where internet access is not a constraint, as in Europe, citizens use e-government mostly to get information (on average 44 percent of individuals in the European countries for which data are available visited a government website at least once in the past year to get information) and not for transacting with government (only 29 percent returned a form online in the past year). These patterns are also reflected in surveys of citizens in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand—countries that rank 8, 10, and 15, respectively, in the provision of online services. <span class="smartlink smartlink--footnote smartlink--005">The majority of respondents use government websites for information and prefer to use traditional channels like voice calls to undertake transactions such as registering their children for day care.</span></p>

      <section>
        <p>Both between and within European countries, the use of e-services depends on income. Three times amany citizens use online services in the richest countries than in the poorest, with a similar gap between the highest and lowest income quartiles within countries (figure 3.5, panel b). Within countries, use is unsurprisingly associated with age, education, and urban residence. Businesses are more likely than individuals to use the internet to transact with the government (figure 3.5, panel c), and the use of e-services by business is also less sensitive to income across countries.</p>

        <p>In low-income countries, limited internet access means that mobile phones, not the internet, drive interconnectedness, as chapter 2 discussed. Surveys of the use of digital technologies in 12 African countries reveal that only 5 percent of individuals had used the internet to obtain information from, or interact with, the government, compared to 63 percent of respondents who had used their mobile phones to contact health workers (figure 3.6). Internet-based e-services will therefore be biased against the poor in developing countries. Mobile e-government portals have become more common, nearly doubling from 25 countries in 2012 to 48 in 2014, but still are not on par with internet services.5 More than three-quarters of countries archive information on their websites for education, health, and finance services, but fewer than half send e-mail or Rich Site Summary (RSS) updates, and only a handful send short message service (SMS) updates.</p>

        <h3>Greater state capability and citizen participation</h3>
        <p>What impact have these significant investments in e-government had on strengthening government capability to deliver services and expanding citizen participation? If politicians and policy makers want to improve services, they need a capable government to convert policies and spending into better outcomes. Resources must be collected and spent without leak- age. Teachers and health workers must be present in classrooms and clinics, and then must be motivated to work. Beneficiaries of government programs must be properly identified and reached. And governments often must help citizens make better decisions, overcoming bad habits or a lack of information. But as underlined in the 2004 World Development Report, Making Services Work for Poor People, and subsequent research, weaknesses in each of these links in the service delivery chain make services fail in develop- ing countries. Improving government capability or implementation capacity is key for effective service delivery.</p>

        <p>Digital technologies can help improve govern- ment capability and citizen participation by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Informing citizens and giving them an official identity</em> so that individuals can make better decisions for their health, their safety, and education for their children, and can access a variety of publicly and privately provided services;</li>
          <li><em>Streamlining processes</em> to reduce discretion and opportunities for rent-seeking, ensuring that public resources are collected and spent efficiently, without leakage;</li>
          <li><em>Receiving feedback</em> from service users to regularly track satisfaction, identify problems, and improve service quality;</li>
          <li><em>Improving service provider management through better monitoring</em> so that government workers both show up at work and are productive.</li>

      </figure>

      <section>
        <p>Digital technologies have had varying impacts across these channels (table 3.1). The clearest impact involves addressing a lack of information and weak communication—citizens’ lack of knowledge about issues that affect their welfare, their inability to com- municate with one another and with government, and government’s inability to be informed about citizens. For example, the provision of information to citizens, particularly to poor citizens in remote locations through mobile phones, has helped people make better decisions on a variety of issues. And dig- ital identification, by giving poor citizens a verifiable identity, has enabled them to participate in public and private services previously denied to them.</p>
        <p>Digital technologies have been less effective in solving government failures associated with rent- seeking and in strengthening the incentives of gov- ernment bureaucrats and service providers to per- form due to principal-agent problems associated with information asymmetries. Automating government functions and services has been at best partially suc- cessful; these are often complex and costly systems to implement. The failure rate is high, and so is the risk of wasting public funds. Citizen feedback has been effective when citizens have an incentive to provide feedback and the services are fairly easy to monitor, and when governments have the capacity to respond to this feedback. It is not effective when these condi- tions are absent. Aside from a few isolated examples of reducing absenteeism, digital technologies have not significantly improved service provider manage- ment in government bureaucracies.</p>

        <h4>Informing citizens and giving them an identity</h4>
        <p>Digital technologies are enabling governments to overcome barriers of geography, low physical con- nectivity, and limited administrative capacity to pro- vide information and deliver services to previously unreached citizens, improving citizen participation and choice. The most popular and promising inno- vations in poor countries entail the use of mobile phones to implement a variety of health interven- tions—so-called “m-health” (mobile health) initiatives. These can focus on either health providers, such as point-of-service data collection, disease surveillance, health-promotion campaigns, and telemedicine; or on citizens, such as SMS reminders to parents to get children vaccinated or to patients to undertake ther- apy (sector focus 3). While hundreds of pilot m-health initiatives are underway, robust evidence in devel- oping country contexts is limited largely to the pos- itive effects of reminding patients to adhere to their antiretroviral therapy schedules.6 Initial results from pilots in Bangladesh, India, South Africa, and Tan- zania suggest that regular SMS communication can induce similar behavior changes in expectant moth- ers by providing information on neonatal health.7 The initial results are also promising from m-health initiatives that assist health providers in recording patient information, monitoring pregnancies, and reporting drug stock-outs.8</p>

        <h3>Box 3.1 Digital technology and crisis management</h3>
        <p>Digital technologies have helped monitor and manage human and natural disasters, such as wars, floods, earth- quakes, and epidemics. The internet can help in coordi- nating data flows and improving the timeliness of decision making, while mobile phones can disseminate vital infor- mation. Social media can also help survivors communicate their status and mobilize volunteer resources and donations outside the disaster zone. A few examples of responses to recent crises show the range of possibilities:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Ebola epidemic in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone created logistical challenges for the organizations that responded, not least how to pay fieldworkers in remote and rural locations, many of them not local. The United Nations Development Programme set up a scheme to use mobile phones to make direct payments to the Ebola response workers in Sierra Leone and Liberia, who num- bered some 60,000 at the height of the crisis.a</li>
          <li>The earthquakes that struck Nepal in April and May 2015 left at least 8,500 people dead, more than 17,000 injured, and many thousands homeless. Although donations came in from all over the world, ensuring that aid reached the areas most a ected proved a challenge. One response, coordinated by Kathmandu Living Labs,b was to develop a dynamic map (quakemap.org) as a centralized platform for displaying incident reports and o ers of assistance. The map is built around the OpenStreetMap and uses the Ushahidi platform for incident reports—both based on open-source software and crowdsourced information.c</li>
          <li>Recovering from conflict and civil war requires long- term nation building, and more than 40 countries have adopted Truth and Reconciliation Commissions (TRCs) to assist in this process.d The Liberia TRC received some 20,000 statements from Liberians, at home and in the diaspora. Many depositions were audio and video recordings, now stored as a permanent memorial at the TRC website (http://trcofliberia.org/). Interestingly, the videos have been viewed four times more often than the TRC’s final report, indicating the reach of multimedia for storytelling at the human scale.e</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>This use of digital technologies to overcome geo- graphic, infrastructure, and administrative bottle- necks to information and communication is particu- larly powerful in emergencies like disease outbreaks, natural disasters, and conflict (box 3.1).</p>
        <p>Digital technologies can also strengthen social norms and promote civic behavior like voluntary tax compliance or energy conservation through “peer comparisons”—making an individual’s actions more observable to others and making others’ actions more observable to the individual.9 For instance, tax evasion is pervasive in developing countries. Some governments collect less than half the taxes due to them.10 Simple behavioral nudges, such as naming and shaming tax delinquents by publishing their names on websites, can be a cost-effective inter- vention even in low government capacity contexts. Such peer comparisons have improved tax com- pliance in Norway and the United States, although the developing country evidence is more mixed.11 Comparisons of a household’s power consumption with that of neighbors, as done by companies like Opower, can also help conserve energy through peer pressure.12</p>
        <p>Weaknesses in civil registration in developing countries mean that approximately 2.4 billion people in the world do not have birth certificates and other official documents to prove who they are, preventing many from opening bank accounts, registering prop- erty, or receiving public transfers.13 Digital identifi- cation (ID) programs that use biometrics to register and authenticate individuals, although complex and thus risky to implement, provide a robust solution to this problem. They enable poor countries to leapfrog the decades-long processes that developed countries went through to build their traditional, paper-based civil registration systems (see spotlight 4). These schemes are expanding; 148 of 197 countries have some form of electronic ID. But only 20 countries have a multipurpose ID with digital signature capa- bility that can be used for multiple online and offline services; 100 have digital identification systems lim- ited to a few functions (services like voting or public sector payroll that cover only subsets of the general population); and 49 have no digital ID of any kind.14</p>
        <p>Evidence on the impact of these schemes, while largely anecdotal, points to significant potential ben- efits of reducing leakages in government welfare programs and empowering women through financial inclusion and access to government cash transfers (box 3.2). Biometric registration, authentication, and pay- ments in India’s National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, the world’s largest workfare program, reduced the time for paying beneficiaries by 29 percent and leakages by 35 percent (see spotlight 4)15. But these schemes are complex and have all the risks of wastage associ- ated with large government information technology projects. They also raise concerns about government surveillance, violation of privacy, and data integrity.</p>
        <p>A more recent initiative around digital informa- tional services is the open data movement, publishing government data in machine-readable format as a plat- form for the private sector to develop applications to deliver new e-services to citizens. Countries continue to join the Open Government Partnership, but initiatives are in their infancy. According to the Global Open Data Index, only 13 percent of the datasets in 110 countries were “open”—public, machine-readable, and nonpropri- etary.16 Many governments have no desire to open their data or lack the capability to do so. Making meaningful, good-quality data publicly available depends on sound core administrative systems—countries with more advanced core systems have greater budget transpar- ency (figure 3.7)—and on effective interministerial cooperation and coordination. The necessary support- ive ecosystem of a vibrant private sector and civil soci- ety to use open data is also often missing.</p>
        <p>The impact after governments open up is also unclear. In the United States and the United Kingdom, the take-up of open data has been limited to a few sec- tors where there is consumer demand, like real estate, transport, energy, and health care, so the private sector has an incentive to develop applications on the open data platform.17 In Kenya, Moldova, and the Philippines, which have opened hundreds of govern- ment datasets, the motive has been more to increase transparency than to spur business opportunities for the private sector. In locales in Kenya and the Philip- pines, fewer than 15 percent of survey respondents with internet access had heard of the Open Data Ini- tiative.18 Some media and civil society organizations use open data in their advocacy campaigns, but such initiatives generally are few and fragmented.</p>

        <h4>Streamlining processes</h4>
        <blockquote>
          <q>Automation applied to an e cient operation will mag- nify the e ciency . . . automation applied to an ine cient operation will magnify the ine ciency.</q>
          <cite>Bill Gates</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The efficiency of some government tasks and services can be improved through automation that eliminates routine manual processes prone to error and manip- ulation, reduces the number of government interme- diaries in a transaction, and establishes audit trails to curtail rent-seeking. Digital registration and payment systems have, for example, significantly reduced leak- ages in transport subsidies for the poor in Colombia (box 3.3). Given the importance of mobilizing and man- aging resources, almost all countries have tried to auto- mate budget preparation, execution, and accounting and some aspects of tax and customs administration. Management information systems are also exten- sively used in education, health, land management, and social protection services. In the past decade, one-stop shops or service centers that provide citizen and business services—such as registration, licensing, records, bill payments—in a single physical space or web portal have become popular, with initiatives in many countries, including Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Brazil, Cambodia, India, Kenya, Moldova, Mozam- bique, Oman, Peru, and Uganda (box 3.4).</p>
        <p>Given the methodological difficulties in measuring government productivity, the impact of e-government must be assessed indirectly through, for instance, changes in firms’ perceptions of tax compliance costs, the competitiveness of government procurement, and corruption in taxation and government contracting after the introduction of e-government systems in a country. These indirect measures, from regular sur- veys of firms in select European and Central Asian countries, show that the impact of e-government is mixed and varies considerably across countries.19</p>
        <p>Filing of taxes electronically (e-filing) is meant to reduce the administrative burden to businesses and citizens by minimizing interactions with tax officials and reducing opportunities for rent-seeking—and by lowering the time it takes businesses to file tax returns, make payments, and receive refunds. Indeed, advanced e-filing systems in a country (e-filing of tax forms and e-payment of taxes) lowered the likelihood of being inspected by tax officials by an average 13 per- cent in select countries in Europe and Central Asia.20 But shifting only to the simpler e-filing system that did not enable online payment of taxes had no effect (figure 3.8, panel a). Nor did e-filing on average reduce the number of visits by tax officials (figure 3.8, panel b). These effects vary considerably across countries, with Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kosovo having the biggest declines in inspections, and Bosnia and Her- zegovina, Montenegro, and Tajikistan reporting an increase in inspections after the introduction of the e-government system. E-filing also lowered firms’ perceptions of paying bribes to tax officials only mar- ginally, with medium-size firms and firms that export less likely to pay bribes to tax officials after the intro- duction of e-filing.</p>

          <p>The 2004 World Development Report, Making Services Work for Poor People, underlined that service delivery failures are largely about failures of accountability and weak government implementation capacity, not about poor policies or lack of resources. It showed how relationships of accountability— between citizens and policy makers, between policy makers and service providers, and between citizens and providers—determine outcomes. Unaccountable politicians target policies and public spending to a narrow set of elites rather than providing public goods to benefit the general population. Managers and providers are unresponsive to policy makers and to citizens, often using their positions to extract rents. And poor citizens are unable to organize collectively to pressure policy makers and providers to address service delivery failures. See also Pritchett, Woolcock, and Andrews 2010.</p>

          <p>Based on the Online Service Index (OSI), published by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. The OSI assesses the range and functionality of government-to-citizen (G2C) and government-to-business (G2B) services offered on the national website of each of the UN’s 193 member states, from simple one-way provision of information, to two-way interaction, to integrated “one-stop” portals. This functionality is based on the standard three-stage classification of e-services in the literature. Informational services are basic websites where citizens can obtain information on government ministries and agencies, access archives, and download forms to apply for public services. Transactional services are chiefly two-way online communications for governments to share information and solicit feedback, and often on government websites that process financial transactions, such as electronic tax filing. Connected services are citizencentric, whole-of-government services. Institutional reform and advanced technologies enable citizens to automatically receive benefits based on life-cycle or economic characteristics. They also allow agencies to easily share data to facilitate service delivery. And they encourage accountability through monitoring and feedback mechanisms. Depending on the intended beneficiary, these services can be classified as government-to-government (G2G), G2C, or G2B (UN 2014).</p>

          <p>For this Report, the World Bank has developed two indexes to measure e-government. The Core Systems index measures the automation and integration of core G2G financial and human resource management systems, as well as revenue-related G2B and G2C systems, in 198 countries, drawing on a global dataset of e-government systems developed by the World Bank. The Digital Identification Systems index measures the presence and scope of digital identification systems in government that can serve as a foundational platform technology for myriad G2G, G2C, and G2B services, also drawing on a global dataset of these systems developed by the World Bank.
